Programming Log

Data Members:

string title - Used to store the shows title
int year1 - Used to store the beginning year of the show
int year2 - Used to store the ending year of the show
string genre - Used to store the genre of the show
string website - Pointless, but stores the website anyway ( Makes the input less of a hassle )
string actorArray[] - Used to store the actors of a show up to 20 in an array

Methods:

void PrintBSTInOrder( BSTNodePtr ) - Used to print all of the nodes in the binary
				     search tree in order ( left, root, right ).

void AddBSTNode( string, int, int, string, string, string [] ) - Used to add a node to the
								 tree in alphabetical order 
								 by title

void STRA( string ) - Used with SearchTitleRActors. Specifically, this function gets the root
		      pointer that allows its sister function to search the entire tree. 

void SearchTitleRActors( BSTNodePtr, string ) - Used to find a list of actors based on a supplied
						string, title, to find the list of actors of a
						requested show.

void SART( string ) - Used with SearchActorsRTitles. Similar to the above function, this function
		      allows its sister function to search the entire linked list with the root
		      pointer.

void SearchActorsRTitles( BSTNodePtr, string ) - This function takes a string, an actor's name,
						 and searches all of the nodes in the tree to
						 find which shows that the actor was a part of.
						 This function returns the titles of the shows
						 that the actor worked on.

void SDRT( int, int ) - Same as STRA and SART.

void SearchDatesRTitles( BSTNodePtr, int, int ) - This function takes two integers, the first
						  being the starting year of the range you want to print,
						  and the second being the ending year of the range.
						  This function essentially allows you to search any range
						  of dates and get the shows that were being aired at that
						  time.
