Section #1
Lab #4
February 15th 2015

Classes and Methods Needed:

First and foremost, I am going to need to figure out how to get a string of input from the
user and then split that string into multiple substrings that can all be accessed by the
program. Then, I am going to need to use some of the code that Bolden gave use to create
the LinkedList class/files. After that is complete. I need to create 3 more files, the
test file, and the stack header file and implementation file. Once all that is done, I can
move on to creating the actual functions needed for the lab. These are +,-,*,/,sq,sqrt,
dup,swap,ps, and quit. Since this program needs to loop continuously, I need to have a 
flag which is changed upon input of the quit keyword. After all of that is completed, I
need to create the correct output as shown in the lab. This will require a change to the
linkedlist class for it to print correctly. After all of the functions have been
implemented and work correctly under normal conditions, I will need to add error checking
for each of the functions. Specifically, I need ot check if there is enough items on the
stack to perform the operation.

Foreseen Problems( Problems that may occur ):

I feel that the hardest part of this lab is figuring out how to split a string as I have
not done this before. Other problems that could occur are problems regarding error 
checking of the functions and setting the flag correctly when the program needs to 
terminate. There may be some problems when implementing the output, but I don't think that
will be too hard to fix. Other than that, I don't expect oo many other problems when I
create this code.
