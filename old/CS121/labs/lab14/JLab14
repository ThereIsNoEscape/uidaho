Difficulties Encounted/Time Spent:

The most difficult part of this lab was getting the counts into each
function and passing them by reference. Editing my code to pass by reference
instead of using global variables took me about 45 minutes to complete.
Another problem I had during this lab was initially creating the data. This
was because I had thought that we needed to directly create the arrays and
pass the arrays themselves into the main file. After finding out that they
needed to be regular files, it was much easier to write functions to create
all of data files that were necessary for this lab. This took me about 1 hour
to complete. The last problem I had was figuring out when the swap count and
the comparison counts needed to be incremented. After some study, I believe
that I placed them correctly and got the correct data out from my functions.
This took me the majority of the time, around 1 and a half hours. In total,
this lab took me around 4 hours to complete.

Lessons Learned:

From this lab, I learned the pros and cons to using each of the
different sorting methods. I also learned that passing the counts
by reference is a lot harder than using a global variable. This lab
also made me learn that it is best to use a function to handle all
of the data files that are to be input instead of the method that I
used in which they were brute forced.


Best/Worst Sorts for each data file:

SelectionSort:
Good:
All files, best for already sorted lists
from low to high.

Quicksort:
Good:
Sorting when low to high
Bad:
Large files and files sorted from high to low

Mergesort:
Good:
When files are small, less than 10000
Bad:
When files are large, around 10000
