Difficulties/Time Management:

For this lab, I found that the greatest part that was troubling for me was understanding
what exactly I needed to do for the lab as it took me 45 minutes. The next part I had 
trouble with was getting the Makefile to recognise testStack and testQueue as 2 separate
files with both containing distinct parts. After taking about 30 minutes solving that, most
of the program was smooth sailing as all of the source code was already there for me. I
had to take the time to fix some of the incosistencies in most of the files that were
given, which only took about 20 minutes, but other than that, not much actually caused me a
great deal of thought. This lab in total took me about 2 hours to complete after all of
the debugging was finished. Most of the lab files that were retrieved from Bolden's page
have been edited to correctly compile and be used for this lab.

Lessons Leanred:

From this lab, I learned mainly how to use the make command to compile files as well as
how to modify the make file to correctly compile the code need to make the program run
correctly. Most of this was solved through trial and error as well as looking at the code
itself for clues on how it ran. I also learned that you can run the executables made and
they work just like if you had compiled them normally.
