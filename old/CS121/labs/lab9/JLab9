Difficulties/Time Required:

I found this lab to be moderately more difficult than the labs previous
as this one returned to stacks. The first part of this lab, creating a Stack
class without a linked list class was slightly difficult, but by far the
easiest part of the lab. The second function, joining the lists by way of
"zipping" was easily the hardest part of the lab. This was because I had 
trouble trying to figure out how to store linked lists in order to in a
way that would make creating a new list easier. At first I tried to create
a new list straight from the original lists, but I was having trouble getting
the nodes to link correctly. After reviewing my notes, I figured out that
I could Pop directly from the original stacks and Push those values. It took 
me about 2 hours and 30 minutes to create the joining function. 
The RemoveNeg() function was a little bit tricky at first, but by using
an array, I found that it became a trivial task. The second function took 
around an hour to make sure the output was correct. In total, this lab took 
me about 4 hours to fully complete.  

Lessons Learned:

This lab helped me learn that arrays are very useful in storing data from
linked lists. In fact, this helped me reailize that anything thing involving
singly-linked lists could be represented in an array. Although I opted for
just direct transfer from the original stacks to a joined one, I see the 
benefit of using arrays as you dont lose your original list. The lab
also helped me learn how to create a stack class without the use of a linked
list stucture working in the background. Finally, I learned that working around
setbacks such as not being able to use objects can be a little demotivating at
first, but helped me learn different ways to solve problems.
