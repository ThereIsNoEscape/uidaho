* Question 1:
*
* When one of the header files was modified, the make command only recompiled
* the cpp files that were affected by the changed header file. This surprised
* me as I assumed that using make just recreated all of the object files each
* time.

g++    -c -o QueueL.o QueueL.cpp
g++    -c -o listQ.o listQ.cpp
g++ -o testQueue testQueue.o QueueL.o listQ.o

* Question 2:
*
* The last arguement for both of the make cases was either testStack with its
* object files, or testQueue with its object files. I figured that regardless
* of any of the files being changed, the test programs would always recompile
* last with all of the object files.
*

bash-4.1$ make clean
rm -f testStack 
rm -f testQueue
rm *.o

* Question 3:
*
* With the make clean command, I was quite surprised to find that it cleaned
* up all of the object files as well as the executable itself. This was 
* incredibly useful to clean up my folder of all of the object files that 
* were created.
