Lab #2
January 29th, 2015

Difficulties:

The first two steps of this lab were not too difficult, as they only too around 20 min.
However, I did have trouble in regards to converting the arguments to different types
as I don't recall doing them before. The first few attempts at getting step four
to work correctly ended up giving me completely wrong answers to the operation being 
executed. I believe that the cause of most of my problems when working on this lab comes
from my inexperience dealing with command line arguments and how they are handled. In
terms of time management for this lab, the first part was quite simple and took me about
20% of the total time it took me to complete the lab, while steps 3 and 4 took the other
80%. After revising the program to work correctly, I found that the problem lied in the
fact that I wasn't using atoi or atof correctly and therefore was getting skewed results.

New Information/Lessons Learned:
 
I learned that converting command line arguments and variables in general require the use
of the C Standard Library in order to access the commands atoi, atof, etc. I was then able
to correctly manipulate the variables once they had been converted from their original type.

Answers to the Questions:

The first argument, argv[0], is the name of the file. The last argument was argv[i],
i being the amount of actual arguments excluding the file name argument. When they are
of different types, the conversion automatically converts the incorrect value to zero.
The program works for all of the standard mathematical operations as ween in the output.
