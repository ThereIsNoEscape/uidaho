Difficulties Encountered/Time Spent:

For this lab, I found that using the supplied code was exponentially easier than
trying to use the linked list class that I had created. At first, I tried using
my own linked list class, but found that it wouldn't add the nodes correctly. 
After I discussed my problem with a classmate, I found that the supplied code 
made the lab much easier than I was making it out to be. The next major problem
I encountered was getting one of my functions to accept a string into a character
array. This was difficult becuase I didn't understand why a string couldn't be
directly converted into a character array. After some searching online, I found
out how to get the string into a character array and that solved my final problem.
Overall, this lab took me around 5 hours to complete. 3 and a half hours coding with
the other hour and a half devoted to debugging and the output necessary for the lab

Lessons Learned:

From this lab, I learned how to convert a string into a character array that can then
be used within a function. The more important lessons that I learned during this lab
is how hash tables function and when they should be used. The flexiblity of hash tables
has given me insight on how each data structure is unique and more capable of handling
different problems.
