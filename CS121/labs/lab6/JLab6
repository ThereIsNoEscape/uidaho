Difficulties/Time Required:

The most difficult part of this lab was getting used to using C and how
it differed from C++. This was mainly problematic when input and output
was concerned as I haven't worked with plain C before. Understanding C
took me about 2 hours total due to being unfamilar with the syntax.
The other hard part about the lab was calculating the variance to find
the standard deviation. Since I was be unable to use a formula in the
while loop that was reading the file, it required the use of an array
to store the data for later use in the function. This took me about 45
minutes to solve and implement correctly in my program. Other than that,
there were not many other major problems that occured over the course
of coding the program.
Total Time Needed: About 3 hours and 20 minutes.

Lessons Learned:

The main lesson of this lab for me was leaning how C worked and how 
it is different from C++. I feel that C is quite simple, but input
and output are a little more complicated than that of C++. I also
learned how to input and output to a file using C which is quite
useful as I had trouble in C++ with file i/o. I also learned how
standard deviation is calculated which was quite interesting to
solve and implement. I felt that this program was meant to be a
crash course in C. Not too hard or easy, but requiring me to step
outside my comfort zone and use a "new" language.
