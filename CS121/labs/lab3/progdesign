Program Design Log:

First off, I am going to need a 1 dimensional array to store the characters, 1 or 0.
Next, I need to create a way for the program to read in files that have an initial 
configuration. Next, I'll need to use either rand or % 1 with a for loop to create
a random configuration. Since there will be two ways in which the initial state 
can be created, it might be a good idea to create a menu before generation to prompt
the user as to which method to use. Another way would be to create two different arrays
to store the two different initial configurations. The only problem with this method is
that the user need to enter a file name so the second method wouldn't work as well. Next,
I'm going to need an incrementing for loop that has two rules to specify if a cell is
alive or dead. The first being if(array[x] == 1){ array[x] = 0 }, the second is 
if(array[x] == 0 && (array[x++] == 1 || array[x--] == 1)) { array[x] = 1 }. I can test
the storage of the initial array by printing it out to the user. Testing the rules is
a bit more tricky as I have to have the array print out several times in order to
track the changes that are occuring within the array. Something for me to keep in mind 
is to decide whether or not I want the array to print after one change or all changes
occur in the array. Since it requires a dynamic array, I will have to change the arrays
to pointers to arrays and set them via the pointers. I think it will take me about 2 hours
to complete this program as infile and ifstream are relatively new to me.
