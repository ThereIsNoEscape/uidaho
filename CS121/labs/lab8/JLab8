Difficulties/Time Required:

For me, this lab wasn't very difficult because it was
simply a continuation of last week's lab. The only difference
being that gdb was used instead of printf statements.
gdb greatly sped up the time it took to find most of the 
errors in the program as you could test each of the 
attributes of the program while finding the specific 
places where the errors occured. I found that gdb helped
me immensely when finding errors as I could test a string 
and the functions while not crashing the program. This lab 
in total took me around 1 hour and 20 minutes to complete 
with 60 minutes spent learning gdb and using gdb to find 
errors while the other 20 minutes was spent documenting 
the errors that were found.

Lessons Learned:

I learned that gdb is a great tool in helping a programmer
find the errors in a program simply by allowing the ability
to test the properties in the program without causing the 
program to immediately close. Another great benefit of using
gdb was being able to go step by step in the program itself
which I found quite interesting. Since this was a continuation
of last weeks lab, I felt that the program was already
familiar and during this lab I didn't find out anything new 
about the program.
