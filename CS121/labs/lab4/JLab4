Section #1
Lab #4
February 17th 2015

Time Required:

For this lab, it took me a considerable amount of time to figure out how to split a string into different strings. In total,
it took me about 4 hours to get istringstream to split the string correctly. For the code of the stack, it took me about 30 min.
The linked list code was the easiest around 20 min and required some change from Prof. Bolden's original code, although
there were some changes that needed to be made regardinig the output. Overall, this program took me about 5 hours of just coding
to complete with about 2 hours spent looking up how to get istringstream to work. 

Difficulties Experienced:

The by and far most difficult challenge for me with this lab was being able to split a string into multiple strings that were all
one line. As I am quite inexperienced in this field, I feel that had I known how to split a string beforehand, this program would
have been a breeze. The only other problems I encountered were those of error checking the methods and operations and getting all
of the if else statements lined up correctly. Regarding the operations, I felt that they were simple enough, but the sqrt, subtract
and divide were giving me problems at points along the way.

Lessons Learned:

This lab helped me learn about how to split strings and then take each of the strings as separate input. I also gaind a lot of insight
on how stacks worked and function. When working with the 5 separate files, I learned how each of the files are related and how to 
include the correct files for each. I also learned that Push, Pop, and Peek, work inside of the Stack implementation files, simplifying
most of the code from main into functions that were then created in the Stack file. I feel that learning how to split strings from a 
single line of input will be invaluable to me with labs to come.
