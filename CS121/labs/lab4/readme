Remember to add an if statement to main that checks if the string is a variable or an
operator, a switch could be useful.

Stacks only need to add from the front.

Don't forget that there is no deleting nodes for this program as it seems to just be
adding and pushing the stack back.

Use the base sample code to get the necessary code for the basics, then
move on to adding the requirements.

Print the top of the stack at the beginning, before the user is able to input.

The required operations other than the basics are sq, sqrt, dup, swap, ps, quit.

All numbers are doubles.

Use error checking. NOTE: Mostly on the input of strings on the extra operations.

sq = v * v
sqrt = ?
dup = v + 1 node of v on top of stack
swap = swap elements 1 and 2 of the stack
ps = print function that prints the values of all of the elements of the stacks
quit = return 0

THINGS TO SOLVE:

Get the input as strings before converting them to doubles if the arey numbers (atod)?

If they are strings, figure out how to make special cases for each of the different
cases. (DON'T PUT THE OPERATORS ON THE STACK!!!)

The necessary functions for a stack. (wait for lecture about this)

Ask about the number of values that can be put in a function before an operator is
required. (2, 3, ?)
