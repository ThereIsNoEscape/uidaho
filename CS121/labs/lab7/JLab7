Difficulties/Time Spent:

This lab was relatively easy as it was only debugging.
However, debugging in itself can take a lot of time as
experienced with this lab. I found that most of the
difficulty came from understanding the functions that
were being used as they were the main errors that were
causing the program to fail. Learning the functions and
being able to fix them took a majority of the time spent
on this lab, around 50-60 min. The other major hinderance
was trying to find where the program kept segmentaion
faulting as it didn't give me any clues as to where to 
find the erroneous code. That segment of code alone took
me about 30 min to find as I am not too familiar with C.
Other than that, the lab wasn't too hard as placing output
statements helped me find and locate the last error that 
occured with the function.
Overall, this function took me around an hour and 45 
minutes to complete.

Lessons Learned:

From this lab, I learned that solving some memory related
errors in code is much easier than that of reading output
statements or trying to stop the program from segmentation
faulting as those errors show up in the compiler even before
you start editing the code. I also learned that seg faults
are incredibly difficult to locate in the code as there is
no assistance in trying to locate the code that is causing
the error. The main thing I learned was how to properly use
strlen and strcpy as I hadn't known about them beforehand.
This lab also has helped me become more aware of the
differences between C and C++, specifically how errors are 
reported. This lab also helped me become better at using
and fixing errors in C code.
